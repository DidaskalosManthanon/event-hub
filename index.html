                <p>
                    <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
                    the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
                    versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
                <p>
                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                    making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
                    at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
                    Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
                    the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable 
                    source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 
                    <q><i lang="la">de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</i></q> (The Extremes of Good 
                    and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory 
                    of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 
                    <q><i lang="la">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..</i></q>, comes from a line in 
                    section 1.10.32.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for 
                    those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from 
                    <q><i lang="la">de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</i></q> by Cicero are also 
                    reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions 
                    from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

                <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
                <p>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable 
                    content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is 
                    that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 
                    &lsquo;Content here, content here&rsquo;, making it look like readable English. 
                    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as 
                    their default model text, and a search for &lsquo;<i lang="la">lorem ipsum</i>&rsquo; 
                    will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved 
                    over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and 
                    the like).

                <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority 
                    have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words 
                    which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of 
                    Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the 
                    middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat 
                    predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the 
                    Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful 
                    of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. 
                    The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, 
                    or non-characteristic words etc.
